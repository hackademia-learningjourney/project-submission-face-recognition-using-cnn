GROUP NAME: TEAM DATA

Project Title: FACE RECOGNITION USING CNN

Group Members:
a)Preeti Poudel
b)Kritika Subedi
c)Shusen Dangol
d)Ekta Rawat

Project Description:
'''It is a deep learning project using Keras with TensorFlow to build a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for face recognition.'''

Summary of our process;
a) Data preparation : we loaded and preprocess our image data and labels.
b) Model Definition : created a CNN model with Keras
c) Model Training : trained the model and evaluate them.
d) Model saving and loading ; after trained model, we save them and later use them for prediction
e) Image preprocessing and prediction: use image and applied the model to make predicitions.

TECH STACK THAT WERE USED IN THIS PROJECT:
a) Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
b) Numerical and Array Operations: NumPy
c) Image Processing: OpenCV
d) Data Handling and Splitting: Scikit-learn
e) Visualization: Matplotlib

These were the tech stack which provided us to setup a comprehensive codes for building, training and evaluating a ML model.
